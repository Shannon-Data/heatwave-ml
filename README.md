# HeatWave ML Code for Performance Benchmarks

HeatWave is an integrated, massively parallel, high-performance, in-memory query accelerator for MySQL Database Service that accelerates performance of MySQL by orders of magnitude for analytics and mixed workloads. It is the only service that enables you to run OLTP and OLAP workloads simultaneously and directly from your MySQL database, without any changes to your applications. This eliminates the need for complex, time-consuming, and expensive data movement and integration with a separate analytics database. Your applications connect to the HeatWave cluster through standard MySQL protocols, and You can manage HeatWave via Oracle Cloud REST APIs, SDKs, and the Console.

MySQL HeatWave users currently do not have an easy way of creating machine-learning models for their data in the database, or generating predictions and explanations for it. Such users, while being database experts, frequently are relatively new to Machine Learning and can benefit from products that streamline the creation and usage of machine learning models. HeatWave ML is the product that addresses this need.
